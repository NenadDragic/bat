In this script, the commands are written in Batch scripting language. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

1. `@echo off`: This command turns off the echoing of commands in the console.

2. `REM`: This is a comment and does not affect the execution of the script. It is used to provide explanations and make the script more readable.

3. `md`: This command is used to create a new directory or folder. Here, four folders named "ORG," "MOV," "MP4," and "CR2" are created.

4. `move`: This command is used to move files from one location to another. It moves files with specific extensions (`.mov`, `.mp4`, and `.CR2`) to the corresponding folders.

5. `copy`: This command is used to copy files from one location to another. It copies files with specific extensions (`.jpg` and `.jpeg`) to the "ORG" folder.

6. `for /d %%D in (*) do`: This is a loop that iterates through all the directories (`/d`) in the current directory. The loop variable `%%D` represents each directory.

7. `dir /b "%%D" | findstr "^" > nul || rmdir /s/q "%%D"`: This line checks if a directory (`%%D`) is empty. If it is empty, it is deleted using the `rmdir` command. The `/s` flag removes the directory and all its subdirectories, and the `/q` flag suppresses confirmation prompts.

8. `echo All tasks completed.`: This line displays the message "All tasks completed."

The script performs the following tasks: creating folders, moving files to specific folders based on their extensions, copying files to a particular folder, and deleting empty directories. Finally, it displays a completion message.
